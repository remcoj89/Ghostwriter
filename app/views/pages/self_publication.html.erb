              <h1>More control over content and design</h1>
              <p>When you self-publish a book, you control what's in it. You control how long it is. And you control how it looks. Of course, if your book isn't good, you have no editor or editorial board to blame.</p>

            <h1>Self-publish with better time to market</h1>
            <p>You can get your book to market in less than a week once it's copy-edited. A traditional publisher takes six to nine months to get a printed book to market. And it won't release the ebook version earlier than the printed one.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <h1>Better longevity when you self-publish</h1>
            <p>When traditional publishers stop marketing a book, the author has little input. As a self-publisher, you can keep your book in print forever. Or at least as long as it takes for readers to discover it.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <h1>Quicker to make revisions when needed</h1>
            <p>Traditional publishing can take months to fix errors. Why? Because publishers print revisions after they've sold off the current inventory. Self-publishers can revise books immediately. That's because they use online ebook re-sellers and printing on demand technology.</p>

            <h1>Higher royalties when you self-publish</h1>
            <p>The royalty you receive from traditional publishers is 10-15% of sale. On the self-published side, Amazon pays a 35-70% royalty.</p>

            <h1>More control over price</h1>
            <p>Self-publishing enables you to change the price of your book at will. You can set a lower price to try to sell more copies or a higher price to communicate higher quality.</p>

            <h1>Easy access to global distribution</h1>
            <p>Self publishing enables you to achieve global distribution of your ebook on day one. Kindle Direct Publishing will list your ebook in 100 countries. Apple's iBookstore reaches 50 countries.</p>

            <h1>Full control of foreign rights</h1>
            <p>If your book is successful, foreign publishers will contact you to buy the rights for their country. In this scenario, you might make more money. You 're not sharing revenue with a traditional publisher.</p>

            <h1>Better access to analytics</h1>
            <p>Most online ebook re-sellers and print on demand printers provide real-time or near real-time sales results. Traditional publishers provide twice-yearly royalty statements - imagine running a business with two sales reports per year.</p>

            <h1>Increased deal flexibility</h1>
            <p>As a self-publisher, you can cut any kind of deal with any kind of organization. Traditional publishers only sell to re-sellers, except for bulk sales of printed books to large organizations.</p>
