          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p class="determine-risk">Why? Because there is more time available to recover any losses and less likelihood of being forced to sell out of the position too early.

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p class="objection">Your objective should guide what types of assets you add to your portfolio. You might want to see the best possible tax results, minimize your risk as much as possible, or focus on a target-date goal, such as retirement. There are three types of investment objectives: growth, growth and income, or income.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p class="trends">Herding behavior is behind most stock market bubbles.
